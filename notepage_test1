How do we determine candidate k-itemsets given frequent (k-1)-itemsets? 

By combining frequent all pairs of 2-itemsets with the same prefix, e.g., (A,C) and (A,E), and then pruning those which contain a subset of 2 items which are not frequent we can arrive at the final 3-itemset candidate pool. For example, (A,C) and (A,E) combine to make the candidate (A,C,E), however if (C,E) was not given as a frequent 2-itemset then we know (A,C,E) cannot be frequent and it is pruned.

PrefixSpan
How would the sequence <abe(f)(bcde)(ab)cf> appear in the projected database for c? 

In the c-projected database the postfix of the sequence would be <(_de)(ab)cf> because we only consider the subsequence prefixed with the first occurrence of c. Note that it does not become <(b_de)(ab)cf> because PrefixSpan only considers the items alphabetically after the given prefix in order to avoid duplicate counting.

Sequential Pattern Mining
What is the difference between ab and (ab)? 

If the sequences represent customer purchases, for example, then ab means a is bought, then b is bought, while (ab) means a and b are bought at the same time.

Is (ab) equivalent to (ba)? 

Yes, order doesn’t matter when items are bought at the same time as indicated by the parenthesis (however some algorithms, such as PrefixSpan, may require alphabetical ordering). Without parenthesis, however, order is important, e.g., ab is not equivalent to ba.

Are gaps allowed in subsequences? 

Yes. As an example, (ab)dac is a valid subsequence of c(abd)edfa(cd).

Graph Pattern Mining
Can a subgraph appear more than once in a single graph in the database? If so, does each occurrence increase the support of the subgraph? 

Yes, a subgraph can have multiple instances in the same graph in the graph database. However, each occurrence doesn’t add to the support of the subgraph, no matter how many times the subgraph appears in a particular graph it will only increase the support of that subgraph by one.

How can one determine if a given graph is a subgraph of another? 

You may consider labeling the nodes of the candidate subgraph and searching for corresponding nodes (and edges between them) in the graph in question.

Part 1 Practice Exam

A database has 5 transactions. Let min sup = 0.6. 

trans id | items bought

1 | A, B, C, D 

2 | A, B, C, E, G 

3 | G, H, I, J 

4 | A, B, C, D, E 

5 | A, F, G, H 

How many frequent 2-itemsets will the database generate?: -> 3 ab,bc,ac -- note its not sequential

Suppose a sequence database D contains three sequences as follows. Note (b c) means that items b and c are purchased together (i.e., in the same transaction).

customer id | shopping sequence

1      |              (b d) a e (f c) d

2      |              a c (d e) c f g

3      |              c f (b d) a e c g

Let the minimum support be 3. Mine all frequent sequential patterns and answer the following question:

How many sequential patterns are frequent in this data (of all lengths k >=1)?: 11 ae,ac,ec,cd,a,e,c,d,b,f,aec -- note non sequence items can be between sequence items

Suppose there are the following three sets of items (i.e., three transactions) in a dataset: 

S1: {a1, a2, a3, a4, … , a99, a100} 

S2: {a1, b2, a3, b4, … , a99, b100}    Note: S2 is formed from S1 by replacing ai with bi if i mod 2 = 0,

S3: {a1, a2, c3, a4, …, c99, a100}      Note: S3 is formed from S1 by replacing aj with cj if j mod 3 = 0,

where ai != bi != ci for i from 1 to 100 ("!=" means "not equals to").

Let min support = 2. 

How many closed frequent patterns are there in this dataset?: -> 3 S1,S2, and S3 are closed frequent patterns


Suppose there are the following three sets of items (i.e., three transactions) in a dataset:

S2: {a1, b2, a3, b4, … , a99, b100}    Note: S2 is formed from S1 by replacing ai with bi if i mod 2 = 0

For mining diverse patterns, which of the following statements is/are correct? Select all that apply.

-> If both items “A” and “B” are frequent, but "A" and "B" occur together rarely,   pattern “A, B”  should be a negative pattern.

-> For mining multiple level patterns, if min-sup thresholds are set differently on different levels, we need to use the lowest min-sup threshold among different levels.  


For frequent-pattern based phrase mining, which of the following statements is/are correct? Select all that apply. 

In phrase mining methods, which include both frequent pattern mining and topic modeling (e.g., KERT, ToPMine), frequent pattern mining is always performed before topic modeling.  

-> Only a small portion of frequent patterns of contiguous words are high quality phrases.

-> Frequent-pattern based methods require significantly reduced human annotation or, for some algorithms, no annotation.
